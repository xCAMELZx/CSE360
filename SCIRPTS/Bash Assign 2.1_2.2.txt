#Option: None 

1. What is wrong with this command? 
 tr A Z < $HOME/temp > $HOME/temp
- The issue lies within the range that has been set after the tf command. In order for the script to understand what has been defined after 'tr' 
the programmer has to ensure that it looks like --> tr 'A-Z' < $HOME/temp > $HOME/temp
The shell provided for this command usually looks like: tr'{}' '()' < infile > outfile 

2. printf -v var="$(printf "%d.%-d\n" $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM $RANDOM | tee FILENAME)"
